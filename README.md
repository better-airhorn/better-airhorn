## Features
### Upload own sound files in many formats
supported audio formats are:

- flac
- mp3
- ogg
- opus
- wav
(and maybe some other formats that haven’t been tested)

just upload them into a channel the bot can read and wait for the bot to react with ”+", then also react with that emoji

### Generous Upload Limit
A single user can upload up to 500MB of Audio, each Sound itself can be up to 50MB big.

Just to put this into perspective, a 2 hours long podcast can be compressed into 90MB, so its safe to say that you wont run out of space soon for all your favorite sounds

### Voice Commands
Do you also hate typing a command whenever you want to play a sound?

me too, thats why this bot can listen for voice commands, try it out!
`$listen` and then clearly say `alexa, (short pause) play sad`
